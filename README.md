# Caustica

Caustica is an experimental ray-traced renderer for Minecraft 26.2's Vulkan backend.
It replaces the vanilla world view with hardware ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS
features while keeping Minecraft's familiar UI and gameplay intact.

Caustica is early software. Expect bugs, missing visual cases, and frequent
changes while the renderer is being built.

## Features

- Vulkan hardware path-traced world rendering
- DLSS Ray Reconstruction support
- DLSS Frame Generation support (experimental)
- HDR output
- Dynamic entity rendering in the ray-traced scene
- LabPBR-style material support
- OMM (Opacity Micro-Map) + SER (Shader Execution Reordering) optimizations

## Requirements

- **Vulkan graphics backend enabled**
- A GPU and driver with Vulkan ray tracing support
- NVIDIA RTX GPU and supported driver for DLSS features
- HDR-capable display and OS HDR mode for HDR output
- On Linux, an HDR-capable Wayland compositor and a native Wayland session for HDR output
- Install LabPBR resource pack like [SPBR](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/spbr) for better visuals

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader for Minecraft `26.2`.
2. Install Fabric API.
3. Put the Caustica jar in your Minecraft `mods` folder.
4. Launch the game with the Vulkan graphics backend.
5. Open Video Settings to adjust Caustica's renderer options.

## Usage Notes

- Caustica is client-side only.
- DLSS Ray Reconstruction and Frame Generation require supported NVIDIA
  hardware and drivers.
- On Linux if Minecraft crashes on startup with stack overflow errors, try adding `-Xss2M` to the Java args to increase the stack size.
- Use Java args to improve performance. Minecraft Launcher default:
  `-XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+UseZGC`
- Frame Generation is experimental and needs to be enabled by modifying the configuration file.
- HDR output requires an HDR swapchain and a correctly configured HDR display.
- When HDR is enabled on Linux, Caustica selects GLFW's native Wayland backend automatically. X11/XWayland surfaces generally do not expose the required HDR10/PQ format.
- If Minecraft falls back to OpenGL after a crash, re-enable the Vulkan backend
  before using Caustica again.

## Compatibility

Caustica takes over the world renderer, so other mods that heavily modify world
rendering, shader pipelines, post-processing, or the Vulkan backend may conflict.
UI-only mods are more likely to work.

## Status

Caustica is not a finished renderer yet. Current work focuses on visual
correctness, world coverage, stability, and making the SDR/HDR presentation
paths behave consistently.
